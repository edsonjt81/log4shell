The LunaSec CLI makes development, testing, and deployment easier.  It can bring up the services we need to use LunaSec locally.

The CLI is available as an NPM module. Add it to your `package.json` along with the aws cdk packages that it depends on:

`yarn add @lunasec/cli --dev`

or

`npm install @lunasec/cli --save-dev`

Make sure the CLI stays at the same version as the `@lunasec` packages we install in this guide.

:::tip
You can also install the CLI package globally with `yarn global add @lunasec/cli` to make manual commands easier - it will automatically use the locally installed copy if you are in your app folder. Call `lunasec --version` to try it out.
:::

### Prerequisites
Your system must have `docker-compose`, `docker`, and `node >= 14` installed.
