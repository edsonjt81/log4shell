LunaSec uses analytics collected from the CLI command in order to improve its performance for 
all developers. The metrics that are collected by the CLI look like: 

```js
{
  command: 'deploy', // or start, or eject, etc
  version: '1.0.7', // The CLI version was used
  env: 'demo', // The environment the CLI is setting up. 
  success: true, // or false if it fails
  error_message: 'some-error-message-that-only-happens-when-success-is-false',
  // UUID that persists in `~/.lunasec/metadata.json`. This help us filter noise of metrics reports coming to us.
  user_id: '1234-1234-1234-1234',
  // versions of different tools depeneded on by the CLI and what the host system is
  system_info: {
    docker_version: '2.0.0',
    docker_compose_version: '2.0.0',
    node_version: '16.0.0',
    host_platform: 'mac',
    host_release: '10.5'
  }
}
```

If you wish to disable these metrics when running the CLI, enable the environment variable: `LUNASEC_DISABLE_CLI_METRICS=true`.
